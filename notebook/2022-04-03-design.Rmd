## 2022-04-03 Design notes

<small>Source: <code>`r knitr::current_input()`</code></small>

This entry contains the VBM1 design notes.

As my design thinking evolves over the course of the project the notes
here will be modified so that this note always reflects my most recent
position. Consequently the head date shouldn't be taken too seriously.

### Objectives

The purpose of the VSA Basic Model project is to develop a basic VSA
model (VBM1), as an alternative to HRR, FHRR, BSC, MAP, etc., which is
conceptually simple as possible, and relatively cheap computationally.
The motivation for this is that VBM1 would be the default VSA model for
empirical projects, that is, it would be the VSA equivalent of the
geneticist's fruit fly.

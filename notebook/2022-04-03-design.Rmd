## 2022-04-03 Design notes

<small>Source: <code>`r knitr::current_input()`</code></small>

This entry contains the VBM1 design notes.

As my design thinking evolves over the course of the project the notes
here will be modified so that this note always reflects my most recent
position. Consequently the head date shouldn't be taken too seriously.

### Objectives

The purpose of the VSA Basic Model project is to develop a basic VSA
model (VBM1), as an alternative to HRR, FHRR, BSC, MAP, etc.
[@kleykoSurveyHyperdimensionalComputing2021], which is conceptually as
simple as possible, and relatively cheap computationally. The motivation
for this is that VBM1 would be the default VSA model for empirical
projects, that is, it would be the VSA equivalent of the geneticist's
fruit fly.

### Design

Design of a VSA model consists of determining a vector space and
defining the operators on that vector space. This section documents the
design choices and the reasoning leading to those choices.

#### Scalar field of the vector space

This section is probably severely hampered by my lack of mathematical
skills, but I can only work with what I've got. VSA models are treated
as [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) and
operators on that vector space. A [vector space is defined
as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Notation_and_definition)
a set $V$ of *vectors* and a field $F$ of *scalars,* and two binary
operators, vector addition (bundling) and scalar multiplication, that
satisfy eight axioms.

The vector spaces of VSA models have extra requirements that make them
special cases of vector spaces. Orthogonality of vectors plays a major
role in VSA systems, so the concept of angles between vectors must be
meaningful - so the vector spaces must be [inner product
spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Normed_vector_spaces_and_inner_product_spaces).
Additionally, VSA models also have a multiplication operator between
vectors (binding), making them [algebras over
fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space#Algebras_over_fields).
Finally, VSA models also have a family of unary permutation operators
(braiding) - I have no idea of the mathematical consequences of that.
However, all these extra features are not relevant to this section,
which is only concerned with the scalar field of the vector space.
